To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein run

or,

```sh
#!/bin/sh
export BASE="/Users/hkim/ramdisk/"
export SRC="unsorted/"
export DESTS='{"A" "a/" "B" "b/" "C" "c/" "D" "d/" "Other" "other/"}'
java -jar target/uberjar/classify.jar
```

## Example usage

```sh
% cd <to this directory>
% npx shadow-cljs watch app
% tar -cf unsorted | (cd ~/ramdisk && tar -xf -)
% code .
clj:user> (start)
% open http://localhost:3000
